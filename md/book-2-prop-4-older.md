## Book II, Prop. IV.

> If a straight line be divided into any two parts, the square of the whole line is equal to the squares of the two parts, together with twice the rectangle contained by the parts.

Let the straight line <span data-math-line data-math-value="AB">AB</span> be divided into any two parts in <span data-math-type data-math-value="C">C</span>;

the square of <span data-math-line data-math-value="AB">AB</span> is equal to

the squares of <span data-math-line data-math-value="AC">AC</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="CB">CB</span>,

and to twice the rectangle contained by <span data-math-line data-math-value="AC">AC</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="CB">CB</span>.

---

Upon <span data-math-line data-math-value="AB">AB</span> describe the square <span data-math-quad data-math-value="ADEB">ADEB</span>,

and join <span data-math-line data-math-value="BD">BD</span>,

and through <span data-math-type data-math-value="C">C</span> draw <span data-math-angle data-math-value="CGF">CGF</span> parallel to <span data-math-line data-math-value="AD">AD</span> or <span data-math-line data-math-value="BE">BE</span>,

and through <span data-math-type data-math-value="G">G</span> draw <span data-math-line data-math-value="HK">HK</span> parallel to <span data-math-line data-math-value="AB">AB</span> or <span data-math-line data-math-value="DE">DE</span>.

---

And because <span data-math-line data-math-value="CF">CF</span> is parallel to <span data-math-line data-math-value="AD">AD</span>, and <span data-math-line data-math-value="BD">BD</span> falls upon them,

the exterior angle <span data-math-angle data-math-value="BGC">BGC</span> is equal to

the interior and opposite angle <span data-math-angle data-math-value="ADB">ADB</span>;

but <span data-math-angle data-math-value="ADB">ADB</span> is equal to the angle <span data-math-angle data-math-value="ABD">ABD</span>;

because <span data-math-line data-math-value="BA">BA</span> is equal to <span data-math-line data-math-value="AD">AD</span>,

being sides of a square;

wherefore the angle <span data-math-angle data-math-value="CGB">CGB</span> is equal to the angle <span data-math-angle data-math-value="GBC">GBC</span>;

and therefore the side <span data-math-line data-math-value="BC">BC</span> is equal to the side <span data-math-line data-math-value="CG">CG</span>;

But <span data-math-line data-math-value="CB">CB</span> is equal also to <span data-math-line data-math-value="GK">GK</span>,

and <span data-math-line data-math-value="CG">CG</span> to <span data-math-line data-math-value="BK">BK</span>;

wherefore the figure <span data-math-quad data-math-value="CGKB">CGKB</span> is equilateral :

It is likewise rectangular;

for <span data-math-line data-math-value="CG">CG</span> is parallel to <span data-math-line data-math-value="BK">BK</span>, and <span data-math-line data-math-value="CB">CB</span> meets them

the angles <span data-math-angle data-math-value="KBC">KBC</span>, <span data-math-angle data-math-value="GCB">GCB</span> are therefore equal to two right angles,

and <span data-math-angle data-math-value="KBC">KBC</span> is a right angle;

wherefore <span data-math-angle data-math-value="GCB">GCB</span> is a right angle;

and therefore also the angles <span data-math-angle data-math-value="CGK">CGK</span>, <span data-math-angle data-math-value="GKB">GKB</span> opposite to these are right angles,

and <span data-math-quad data-math-value="CGKB">CGKB</span> is rectangular;

but it is also equilateral, as was demonstrated;

wherefore it is a square, and it is upon the side <span data-math-line data-math-value="CB">CB</span>:

For the same reason <span data-math-line data-math-value="HF">HF</span> also is a square,

and it is upon the side <span data-math-line data-math-value="HG">HG</span>, which is equal to <span data-math-line data-math-value="AC">AC</span>:

Therefore <span data-math-line data-math-value="HF">HF</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="CK">CK</span> are the squares of <span data-math-line data-math-value="AC">AC</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="CB">CB</span>;

and because the complement <span data-math-line data-math-value="AG">AG</span> is equal to the complement <span data-math-line data-math-value="GE">GE</span>,

and that <span data-math-line data-math-value="AG">AG</span> is the rectangle contained by <span data-math-line data-math-value="AC">AC</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="CB">CB</span>,

for <span data-math-line data-math-value="GC">GC</span> is equal to <span data-math-line data-math-value="CB">CB</span>;

therefore <span data-math-line data-math-value="GE">GE</span> is also equal to the rectangle <span data-math-line data-math-value="AC">AC</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="CB">CB</span>;

wherefore <span data-math-line data-math-value="AG">AG</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="GE">GE</span> are equal to twice the rectangle <span data-math-line data-math-value="AC">AC</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="CB">CB</span>:

And <span data-math-line data-math-value="HF">HF</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="CK">CK</span> are the squares of <span data-math-line data-math-value="AC">AC</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="CB">CB</span>;

wherefore the four figures <span data-math-line data-math-value="HF">HF</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="CK">CK</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="AG">AG</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="GE">GE</span> are equal to the squares of <span data-math-line data-math-value="AC">AC</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="CB">CB</span>, and to twice the rectangle <span data-math-line data-math-value="AC">AC</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="CB">CB</span>:

But <span data-math-line data-math-value="HF">HF</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="CK">CK</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="AG">AG</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="GE">GE</span>, make up the whole figure <span data-math-quad data-math-value="ADEB">ADEB</span>,

which is the square of <span data-math-line data-math-value="AB">AB</span>:

Therefore the square of <span data-math-line data-math-value="AB">AB</span> is equal to

the squares of <span data-math-line data-math-value="AC">AC</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="CB">CB</span> and twice the rectangle <span data-math-line data-math-value="AC">AC</span>, <span data-math-line data-math-value="CB">CB</span>.

Wherefore if a straight line, &c. QED.
