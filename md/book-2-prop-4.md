### Book II, Prop. IV.


> *Thm.* If a straight line be divided into any two parts, the square of the whole line is equal to the squares of the two parts, together with twice the rectangle contained by the parts.


Let the straight line <span data-math="AB">AB</span> be cut at random at <span data-math="C">C</span>.

I say that the square on <span data-math="AB">AB</span> equals the sum of the squares on <span data-math="AC">AC</span> and <span data-math="CB">CB</span> plus twice the rectangle <span data-math="AC">AC</span> by <span data-math="CB">CB</span>.

Describe the square <span data-math="ADEB">ADEB</span> on <span data-math="AB">AB</span>. Join <span data-math="BD">BD</span>. Draw <span data-math="CF">CF</span> through <span data-math="C">C</span> parallel to either <span data-math="AD">AD</span> or <span data-math="EB">EB</span>, and draw <span data-math="HK">HK</span> through <span data-math="G">G</span> parallel to either <span data-math="AB">AB</span> or <span data-math="DE">DE</span>.

Then, since <span data-math="CF">CF</span> is parallel to <span data-math="AD">AD</span>, and <span data-math="BD">BD</span> falls on them, the exterior angle <span data-math="CGB">CGB</span> equals the interior and opposite angle <span data-math="ADB">ADB</span>.

But the angle <span data-math="ADB">ADB</span> equals the angle <span data-math="ABD">ABD</span>, since the side <span data-math="BA">BA</span> also equals <span data-math="AD">AD</span>. Therefore the angle <span data-math="CGB">CGB</span> also equals the angle <span data-math="GBC">GBC</span>, so that the side <span data-math="BC">BC</span> also equals the side <span data-math="CG">CG</span>.

But <span data-math="CB">CB</span> equals <span data-math="GK">GK</span>, and <span data-math="CG">CG</span> to <span data-math="KB">KB</span>. Therefore <span data-math="GK">GK</span> also equals <span data-math="KB">KB</span>. Therefore <span data-math="CGKB">CGKB</span> is equilateral.

I say next that it is also right-angled.

Since <span data-math="CG">CG</span> is parallel to <span data-math="BK">BK</span>, the sum of the angles <span data-math="KBC">KBC</span> and <span data-math="GCB">GCB</span> equals two right angles.

But the angle <span data-math="KBC">KBC</span> is right. Therefore the angle <span data-math="BCG">BCG</span> is also right, so that the opposite angles <span data-math="CGK">CGK</span> and <span data-math="GKB">GKB</span> are also right.

Therefore <span data-math="CGKB">CGKB</span> is right-angled, and it was also proved equilateral, therefore it is a square, and it is described on <span data-math="CB">CB</span>.

For the same reason <span data-math="HF">HF</span> is also a square, and it is described on <span data-math="HG">HG</span>, that is <span data-math="AC">AC</span>. Therefore the squares <span data-math="HF">HF</span> and <span data-math="KC">KC</span> are the squares on <span data-math="AC">AC</span> and <span data-math="CB">CB</span>.

Now, since <span data-math="AG">AG</span> equals <span data-math="GE">GE</span>, and <span data-math="AG">AG</span> is the rectangle <span data-math="AC">AC</span> by <span data-math="CB">CB</span>, for <span data-math="GC">GC</span> equals <span data-math="CB">CB</span>, therefore <span data-math="GE">GE</span> also equals the rectangle <span data-math="AC">AC</span> by <span data-math="CB">CB</span>. Therefore the sum of <span data-math="AG">AG</span> and <span data-math="GE">GE</span> equals twice the rectangle <span data-math="AC">AC</span> by <span data-math="CB">CB</span>.

But the squares <span data-math="HF">HF</span> and <span data-math="CK">CK</span> are also the squares on <span data-math="AC">AC</span> and <span data-math="CB">CB</span>, therefore the sum of the four figures <span data-math="HF">HF</span>, <span data-math="CK">CK</span>, <span data-math="AG">AG</span>, and <span data-math="GE">GE</span> equals the sum of the squares on <span data-math="AC">AC</span> and <span data-math="CB">CB</span> plus twice the rectangle <span data-math="AC">AC</span> by <span data-math="CB">CB</span>.

But <span data-math="HF">HF</span>, <span data-math="CK">CK</span>, <span data-math="AG">AG</span>, and <span data-math="GE">GE</span> are the whole <span data-math="ADEB">ADEB</span>, which is the square on <span data-math="AB">AB</span>.

Therefore the square on <span data-math="AB">AB</span> equals the the sum of the squares on <span data-math="AC">AC</span> and <span data-math="CB">CB</span> plus twice the rectangle <span data-math="AC">AC</span> by <span data-math="CB">CB</span>.

Therefore if a straight line is cut at random, the square on the whole equals the squares on the segments plus twice the rectangle contained by the segments.
